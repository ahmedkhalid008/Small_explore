Greeting from Khalid Ahmed Tepu.
Today I explore a nice thing in python programmig which is a new user input taking option named "eval"
It creates a soution of an equation without any issue. When you take any kind of user input and want to make any operation on it . Then you can use this "eval" function for 
solving this type of equation . The programme will looks like :-

#The optimal using Function which is workable in python.

r = eval(input("Enter your equation here :  "))
print(r)
