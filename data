1.full table copy 

CREATE TABLE new_table LIKE old_table; 

2.full table data insert into new table

INSERT INTO new_table
SELECT *
FROM old_table;

3.if there is any space in column name then it should replace with _ for analysis data more accurately

ALTER TABLE table_naem 
CHANGE COLUMN `old_tablename` `new_tabelname` VARCHAR(50);



4.Duplicate data check

SELECT COL_1,COL_2, COL_3,COL_4, COL_5, COL_6,COL_7, COL_8, COUNT(*) AS count_duplicates 
FROM khalid GROUP BY COL_1,COL_2, COL_3,COL_4, COL_5, COL_6,COL_7, COL_8 
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;

5.count 

SELECT 
    SUM(CASE WHEN `COL_1` = 'Male' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS Male_Count,
    SUM(CASE WHEN `COL_1` = 'Female' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS Female_Count
FROM studentsperformance;



6.

Now if we want to know that what type of item or are existing in a sepate column then we can use this SQL :

select COL_4,
count(*) as total_count 
from khalid
group  by COL_4;


7. to add a serial to my existing table data

ALTER TABLE khalid
ADD COLUMN serial INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY;


8. to make each first letter capital of a column 

UPDATE khalid
SET Parental_Education_Level = CONCAT(
    UPPER(SUBSTRING(Parental_Education_Level, 1, 1)),
    LOWER(SUBSTRING(Parental_Education_Level, 2))
);

9.to check NULL values in a table 

SELECT
    SUM(CASE WHEN Reading   _Score IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS Gender_n,
    SUM(CASE WHEN Writing_Score IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS e
 
FROM khalid;

10. Totall Row count : 

SELECT COUNT(*)
from table_name
