#There is tricks for sorting in Python . 

We Know that , Binary Search is a great Algorithm for Data structure and Algorithm .
So , when we want to perform Binary search in any array  then Array should be in a sorted Mode.
To Perform this sorting Operation Quickly , we can this Build in Mehtod in Python . 

-- .sort() 

Suppose An Array is given have a to sort it . 

Given Array ,

arr=[64,34,55,22,12,13,14,15,61,18,19,17]
arr.sort()       #simply use this method to sort in Only two lines.
print(arr)


Then the Array will sorted in a very short time and will be a time saving and more benificial for the Coders .
